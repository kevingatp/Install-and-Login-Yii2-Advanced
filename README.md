Yii 2 Advanced Project Template is a skeleton [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for
developing complex Web applications with multiple tiers.

## PREREQUISITES
Before we start to build our own application, firstly we should have web server and IDE in our local device.

**Web Server**
There are some excellent all-in-one Windows distributions that contain Apache, PHP, MySQL and other applications in a single installation file, e.g. **XAMPP (including a Mac version)**, **WampServer** and **Web.Developer**. In here I used **XAMPP** as Web Server.

**IDE**
There are some excellent IDE for PHP such as NetBeans, Notepad++, and Sublime Text 3, but for me NetBeans is the most popular IDE for development. NetBeans editor provides many pre-configured code templates and code generation tools for faster development support, and In her I used **NetBeans** for IDE.

DOWNLOAD:
    - XAMPP-7.3.3-1_[Download]_(https://pages.github.com/) for Windows x64
    - NetBeans-11.0*[Download]*(https://pages.github.com/)
